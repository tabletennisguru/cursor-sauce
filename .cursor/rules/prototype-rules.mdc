When I ask you to...
- Create a new prototype
- Make a new prototype
- Create prototype
- Make prototype

Or any other language similar to this. Do the following steps:

1. If I don't tell you what the prototype will be, ask me to name the prototype before proceeding with creating the prototype.
2. Always copy the `_template` directory in the `app/prototypes` directory. 
3. Create/modify the prototype files (page.tsx, styles.module.css, etc.)
4. Install any necessary dependencies
5. Add the prototype to the homepage's prototypes array
6. Test that both the prototype and homepage links work
